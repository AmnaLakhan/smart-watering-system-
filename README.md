Smart Watering System

A Smart Watering System that automatically waters plants based on soil moisture levels using an Arduino, soil moisture sensor, and a relay-controlled water pump.
This project helps save water, reduces manual effort, and ensures plants stay healthy — perfect for home gardens, hostels, and small farms.
Features

Automated watering based on soil moisture readings

Manual pump control (optional, via Bluetooth application)

Low-power, efficient operation

Real-time monitoring of soil conditions

Easy to set up and customize
Components Used

Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano

Soil Moisture Sensor (Analog)

1-Channel Relay Module

5V DC Water Pump

Power Supply (5–12V depending on pump)

Bluetooth Module HC-05/HC-06 (optional)
Working Principle

The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture content of the soil.

The Arduino reads the sensor value and compares it to a threshold.

If the moisture level is below the threshold, the Arduino activates the relay, which turns on the water pump.

Once sufficient moisture is detected, the pump is automatically turned off.

When Bluetooth control is enabled, the user may override the automatic mode and operate the pump manually.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple, cost-effective solution for automated plant irrigation. It is suitable for students, hobbyists, home gardeners, and small-scale agricultural setups.
