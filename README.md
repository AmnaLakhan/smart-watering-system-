<h2> Smart Watering System </h2>

A simple, automated watering solution that monitors soil moisture and waters plants only when needed. This project helps reduce water waste and keeps plants healthy—even when you’re not around.


<h2> Features <br> </h2>

Automatic Watering based on soil moisture levels

Real-time Monitoring of sensor readings

Manual Override Option to control the pump yourself

Energy-Efficient Operation using microcontroller sleep modes (optional)

Beginner-Friendly Setup with easy components

<h2> Components Used </h2>

Arduino / ESP8266 / ESP32 (choose your controller)

Soil Moisture Sensor

Relay Module

Water Pump

Jumper Wires

Power Supply

(Optional) LCD Display or IoT Dashboard

<h2> How It Works </h2>

The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture level.

If the reading is below the threshold, the system automatically turns ON the water pump.

When moisture returns to normal, the pump turns OFF.

All sensor data can be displayed on a screen or sent to an IoT platform.
